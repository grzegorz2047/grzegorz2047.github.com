Hi, some time ago I started learning about java design patterns because as a java developer
I should have some knowledge about how to create good java application.
In java, people use different patterns to help create good code. For example we have 
GRASP patterns, SOLID patterns and much more.
In this post I'm going to describe strategy pattern. The reason is simple. Firstly, I'd like to
memorize it, secondly, in case when I forget it I'd like to go back and look at it.
Also maybe someone will learn something new if someone have never heared about design patterns.
So, when do we use strategy pattern?
We use it when we have to implement different algorithms which are used interchangeably.
So for example, when we have different types of discounts, how should we implement it?
Let's say, that we have a shop and we want to give 20% discount for our products to all students.
We can create class Product:
{% highlight java %}
public class Product {
	
	private String name;
	private BigDecimal price;

	public Product(String name, BigDecimal price) {
		this.name = name;
		this.price = price;
	}
}
{% endhighlight %} 
Let's stop for a second and think, how beginner java programmer would implement it?
He would probably think, that Product can compute discount for himself.
It would look like something like that:

{% highlight java %}
public class Product {
	
	private String name;
	private BigDecimal price;

	public Product(String name, BigDecimal price) {
		this.name = name;
		this.price = price;
	}
	
	public BigDecimal computeDiscount(String discountName) {
		if(discountName == "student") {
			return (price * 20)/100;
		}
		if(discountName == "newclient") {
			return (price * 10)/100;
		}
	}
}
{% endhighlight %} 

What if we want to implement discounts for 10 or even more types of people?
Then, in this case, we add more if's!
Well, that would work, but it's not really good idea.
So in this case, we can use Strategy pattern.
So basically we will provide for our Product Discount interface, so when we will be computing
discount, we simply give specific algorithm, which gives us appropriate discount.
To do this, let's create an interface called Discount:

{% highlight java %}
public interface Discount {
	
	BigDecimal compute(BigDecimal price);

}
{% endhighlight %} 
 
Now, let's implement it to for our student discount:

{% highlight java %}
public class StudentDiscount implements Discount {
	
	public BigDecimal compute(BigDecimal price) {
		BigDecimal discount = new BigDecimal("0.8");
		return price.multiply(discount);
	}
}
{% endhighlight %} 
and for new client discount:

{% highlight java %}
public class NewClientDiscount implements Discount {
	
	public BigDecimal compute(BigDecimal price) {
		BigDecimal discount = new BigDecimal("0.9");
		return price.multiply(discount);
	}
}
{% endhighlight %} 

Let's apply it to our Product class:

{% highlight java %}
public class Product {
	
	private String name;
	private BigDecimal price;
	private Discount discountStrategy;

	public Product(String name, BigDecimal price) {
		this.name = name;
		this.price = price;
	}
	
	public BigDecimal computePrice() {
		return discountStrategy.compute(price);
	}
	
	public void applyDiscount(Discount discount) {
		this.discountStrategy = discount;
	}
}
{% endhighlight %} 

What about case when there is no discount?
Simply add discount, where we return full price:

{% highlight java %}
public class NoDiscount implements Discount {
	
	public BigDecimal compute(BigDecimal price) {
		return price;
	}
}
{% endhighlight %} 

So finally, our Product class should look like that:

{% highlight java %}
public class Product {
	
	private String name;
	private BigDecimal price;
	private Discount discountStrategy;

	public Product(String name, BigDecimal price) {
		this.name = name;
		this.price = price;
		this.discountStrategy = new NoDiscount();
	}
	
	public BigDecimal computePrice() {
		return discountStrategy.compute(price);
	}
	
	public void applyDiscount(Discount discount) {
		this.discountStrategy = discount;
	}
}
{% endhighlight %} 

Now we can use our classes in practice. 
Now we can create class called Order, where we'll store all Products and summarise price
and also we can create our Main class to make it work.

{% highlight java %}
public class Order {
	private ArrayList<Product> products = new ArrayList<Product>();

	private String summarise() {
		BigDecimal summarisedPrice = new BigDecimal("0");
		for(Product : products) {
			summarisedPrice = BigDecimal.add(product.computePrice());
		}
	}
	public void addProduct(Product product) {
		products.add(product);
	}
	public void removeProduct(Product product) {
		if(products.contains(product) {
			product.remove(product);
		}
	}
}
{% endhighlight %} 

And in Main class we can do this:

{% highlight java %}
public class Main {
	
	public static main(String[] args) {
		Product p1 = new Product("Drink Mix", 5);
		Product p2 = new Product("Snacks Nice", 5);
		Product p3 = new Product("Water COOL", 5);
		
		p1.applyDiscount(new NewClientDiscount());
		p2.applyDiscount(new StudentDiscount());
		
		Order o = new Order();
		o.addProduct(p1);
		o.addProduct(p2);
		o.addProduct(p3);
		
		System.out.println("Summarised price is " + o.summarisedPrice();
		);
	}
}
{% endhighlight %} 

So that's how you can implement strategy pattern. It's quite easy to implement it.
Let's see on good sides and bad sides of this pattern.
So good thing is that you can create class which doesn't have to be touched every time
when you want to implement new algorithm to compute your discount. And you don't have write
those if's statements.

From the other side, you have to know what algorithm you want to implement and you have to
create new class for each discount algorithm.

Ok, and that's it what you have to know to use stategy pattern in your project.
Have fun!
